# Tic Tac Toe
Simple tic-tac-toe game using React and Redux with Typescript.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. I used [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for organising actions, reducers and selectors. I like it's approach to have everything in one "slice" file and write much less code, than with Redux's original logic.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
The test suite implemented using Jest.<br />

Test source location is: src/Game/slice.test.ts
